In development of modern web application, your service usually consumed by various\nkinds of clients with different manners. You may have web site for browser user, private apis for mobile clients, public\napis for third-party developers and internal apis for queues or job workers. Genji helps you write reusable code by\nproviding extensible plugin/middleware system, routing/transport agnostic application class, models fields validation\nand custom getter/setter method, views layout manager and namespaced template overriding, url routing with hook support.\nWhile it doesn't mean you have to stick with a particular development style or technology, genji is highly modular\ndesigned and customizable, so you can decide which part of the framework to use and how.\n\n- For documentations see: [http://lsm.github.com/genji](http://lsm.github.com/genji)\n- Check out the [test coverage](http://lsm.github.com/genji/coverage.html) and [plato report](http://lsm.github.com/genji/plato) for source analysis\n- Ideas, bug report or general discussion are always welcome, feel free to open issue at: [https://github.com/lsm/genji/issues](https://github.com/lsm/genji/issues)\n\n\n### About the name \"Genji\"\n\nThe word `Gen` `Ji` in Chinese means `root` `base` and it's also the name of the\n[Japanese era name][genji] which was created to mark the beginning of a new 60-year\ncycle of the Chinese zodiac. So, basically it means something **fundamental** that you can **grow with**.\nThe philosophy of this project follows this meaning.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2013 Senmiao Liu <senmiao.liu@gmail.com>\n\n[genji]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genji_(era) \"Genji (era)\"",
